    "00. We're using a Jupyter Notebook environment (tutorial available here: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html),\n",
    "01. Read the entire notebook before beginning your work, \n",
    "02. Output format should be exactly as requested (it is your responsibility to make sure notebook looks as expected on Gradescope),\n",
    "03. Each helper function should be preceeded by documentation (Markdown cell),\n",
    "04. No comments in the code; anything worth mentioning should be included in the documentation,\n",
    "05. Use descriptive variable names,\n",
    "06. Functions should do only one thing,\n",
    "07. Check submission deadline on Gradescope, \n",
    "08. Rename the file to Last_First_assignment_5, \n",
    "09. Submit your notebook (as .ipynb, not PDF) using Gradescope, and\n",
    "10. Do not submit any other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directions _not_ applicable for this Assignment:\n",
    "* Do not use classes,\n",
    "* Keep functions to 20 lines or less (including empty lines so do not add any),\n",
    "* Each helper function should be followed by three assert-style unit tests.\n",

    "## Before You Submit...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Re-read the general instructions provided above, and\n",
    "2. Hit \"Kernel\"->\"Restart & Run All\"."
